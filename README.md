This code uses nested loops to iterate through rows and columns and prints
different characters based on the current row and column positions. The code is
divided into three sections to create different parts of the pattern. Here's a brief
overview of each section: First Section : This section generates a pattern
resembling a combination of 'X' and 'Z' shapes within a rectangular boundary. It
also includes '-' characters in the middle. Second Section: This section generates a
set of vertical lines ('|') and '%' characters in the middle to create a vertical bar
pattern. Third Section : This section combines vertical lines ('|'), '*', and spaces to
create a more intricate pattern with horizontal and vertical bars, as well as
asterisks.
